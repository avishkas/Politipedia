      Websites currently exist to solve one of the subproblems that we solve, or provide for an individual use case. No competitors provide the comprehensive level of detail that our product provides. For example, ballotpedia.org gives users information regarding all candidates for a race, but provides no information regarding the candidates themselves, contributors to the candidates, or social media perception. The same analysis also applies to websites such as opensecrets.org and govtrack.us. The real advantage over competitors is that comprehensive information regarding candidates is presented in one location so that users can more easily have informed opinions regarding candidates.

  <ngb-panel title = "Why is it desireable and worth developing?">
    <ng-template ngbPanelContent>
      The information necessary for a voter to make an informed political decision during federal elections is currently scattered across a multitude of news outlets, web-based encyclopedias, and databases with antiquated UIs. Our product is desirable because it alleviates this issue by compiling relevant information on political campaigns and elections into an easy-to-understand format with an easily-navigable user interface. This product is worth developing because many citizens, inundated with unorganized data, struggle to conduct proper research into the financials and backgrounds of political candidates. In many cases, this lack of knowledge results in uninformed voters or low voter participation during federal elections. Our product is also desirable because it allows prospective voters to not only research individual candidates/campaigns but also get an overview of a particular election as a whole, including information regarding candidates and relevant news articles.
